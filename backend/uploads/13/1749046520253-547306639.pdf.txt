Subject: Request for Anonymized Patient Data for Research on Early Detection of Heart 
Disease 
Dear Sir/Madam, 
We hope this letter finds you well. We are a research team from the Department of Computer 
Science and Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), 
currently engaged in a project on early detection of heart disease using advanced machine 
learning algorithms. The goal of our study is to develop a predictive system that can identify 
patients at risk of heart disease at an early stage—thereby facilitating timely medical intervention 
and improving overall healthcare outcomes. 
To ensure the accuracy, robustness, and real-world applicability of our models, we are seeking 
access to anonymized patient health records containing a comprehensive set of diagnostic and 
lifestyle-related attributes. 
We are specifically interested in the following medical and lifestyle attributes: 
Medical Attributes 
1. Age ( range 15–40) 
2. Sex (male/ female) 
3. Chest pain type (1.typical angina, 2.atypical angina, 3.non-anginal pain, 4. asymptomatic) 
4. Resting blood pressure (mmHg) 
5. HDL/LDL cholesterol levels (mg/dL) 
6. Fasting blood sugar (>120 mg/dL) 
7. Blood sugar levels (HbA1c) 
8. Random blood sugar  
9. Resting electrocardiographic results  
10. Maximum heart rate achieved 
11. Exercise-induced angina (Yes / No) 
12. Body Mass Index (BMI) 
13. Diabetes status (Type 2 history) (Yes / No) 
14. Family history of heart disease (Yes / No) 
15. Triglyceride levels (mg/dL) 
16. Diagnosis (Yes / No)  if yes → 
I. Myocardial Infarction (MI) 
II. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) 
III. Valvular Heart Disease (VHD) 
IV. Atrioventricular (AV) Block 
 

Lifestyle & Socio-Demographic Attributes 
1. Smoking status (current / former / non-smoker) 
2. Physical activity level (sedentary / moderate / active) 
3. Alcohol consumption (none / occasionally / frequently) 
4. Dietary habits  
5. Stress level / mental health (low / medium / high) 
6. Sleep duration and quality (poor / fair / good) 
7. Occupation type  
8. Marital status  
 
We assure you that: 
➢ The data will be used strictly for academic and research purposes. 
➢ No personally identifiable information (PII) will be collected or disclosed. 
➢ Data will be securely stored in compliance with all applicable ethical and privacy 
standards. 
➢ We are fully prepared to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) or Data Sharing 
Agreement (DSA), as required by your institution. 
 
Your support in providing such data will significantly contribute to the development of 
innovative healthcare technologies aimed at early intervention and preventive care. 
Should you have any questions or require further information, we would be happy to provide 
additional details or arrange a meeting. You may reach us at the contact information provided 
below. 
Thank you very much for considering our request. We look forward to your kind cooperation. 
Sincerely, 
 Adibah Mahmud
